Hi, my name is Eric! I'm a **first-year Ph.D. student** at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [**Srijan Kumar**](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie broadly in **computational social science, natural language processing, and machine learning**. Currently, I am investigating the **dynamics and impact of online misinformation and counter-misinformation**. Questions I am trying to answer include: 
- (1) What kinds of misinformative content and misinformation posters are more likely to receive countering / debunking from ordinary online users?
- (2) What kinds of users are more likely to be the creators of misinformation-countering content?
- (3) What are the impacts of countering on the spread of online misinformation?

In May 2023, I presented my [paper](https://yma17.github.io/files/websci23-17.pdf), **"Characterizing and Predicting Social Correction on Twitter"**, at the [15th ACM Web Science Conference (WebSciâ€™23)](https://websci23.webscience.org/) in Austin, TX. I am continuing to focus on the Twitter platform for my research, while also expanding to other platforms such as Reddit. I have also worked in projects in urban road repair and mental health.

Overall, I enjoy working in **inter-disciplinary projects**, particularly at the intersection of computer science and humanities / public policy. I am motivated by a desire to help both stakeholders and ordinary people better understand and model complex societal phenomena, in the hope of bringing about tangible benefits and healthier societal outcomes.
