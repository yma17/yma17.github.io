Hi, my name is Eric! I'm a second-year Master's student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) with a Specialization in Machine Learning.

I am interested in computational social science, natural language processing, machine learning, and data science. I am currently serving as a Graduate Research Assistant at GT, under the direction of Prof. [Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/), to investigate the nature and impact of counter-misinformation on Twitter. My [paper](https://yma17.github.io/files/websci23-17.pdf) on this topic, "Characterizing and Predicting Social Correction on Twitter", was recently accepted to the [15th ACM Web Science Conference (WebSciâ€™23)](https://websci23.webscience.org/). I have also worked in projects in urban road repair, mental health, and politics.

Overall, I enjoy working in inter-disciplinary projects, particularly at the intersection of computer science and humanities / public policy. I am motivated by a desire to help both stakeholders and ordinary people better understand and model complex societal phenomena, in the hope of bringing about tangible benefits and healthier societal outcomes.
