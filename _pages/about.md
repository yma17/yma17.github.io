Hi, my name is Eric! I'm a **2nd-year Ph.D. student** at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [**Srijan Kumar**](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/). My research interests lie broadly in **natural language processing, large language models, multimodal machine learning, and computational social science**.

Currently, I am working on two projects. In the **first**, I am investigating the **dynamics of online misinformation and counter-misinformation**. Questions I am trying to answer include:
- (1) What kinds of misinformative content and misinformation posters are more likely to receive countering or debunking from ordinary online users?
- (2) What kinds of users are more likely to be the creators of misinformation-countering content?

In the **second**, I am developing a benchmark for **robustness of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realistic and plausible concept-level perturbations** in the text and image modalities. Specifically:
- (1) I am working to create an extensive suite of input perturbations to enable a vigorous evaluation of MLLMs' robustness.
- (2) I am looking to develop LLM techniques to make MLLMs more robust to such perturbations.

In May 2023, I presented my [paper](https://yma17.github.io/files/websci23-17.pdf), **"Characterizing and Predicting Social Correction on Twitter"**, at the [15th ACM Web Science Conference (WebSciâ€™23)](https://websci23.webscience.org/) in Austin, TX. For my work, I was awarded the **Marshal D. Williamson Fellowship** at Georgia Tech's 32nd College of Computing Awards. Since then, I have participated in several other projects, served as an author on multiple other publications, and served as a reviewer for ICWSM '25 and HKS Misinformation Review.

Overall, I enjoy working in **inter-disciplinary projects**, particularly at the intersection of computer science and humanities / public policy. I am motivated by a desire to help both stakeholders and ordinary people better understand and model complex societal phenomena, in the hope of bringing about tangible benefits and healthier societal outcomes.
