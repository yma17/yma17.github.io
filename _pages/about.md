Hi, my name is Eric! I'm a **2nd-year CS Ph.D. student** at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by Prof. [**Srijan Kumar**](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and part of the [**Computational Data Science Lab for the Web and Social Media (CLAWS) Lab**](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/). My research interests lie broadly in **natural language processing, large language models, multimodal machine learning, and computational social science**.

I have 3+ years research and 7+ years programming experience. In 2023, I presented my [paper](https://yma17.github.io/files/websci23-17.pdf), **"Characterizing and Predicting Social Correction on Twitter"**, at the [15th ACM Web Science Conference (WebSciâ€™23)](https://websci23.webscience.org/) in Austin, TX. The same year, I was awarded the **Marshal D. Williamson Fellowship** at Georgia Tech's 32nd College of Computing Awards. I have contributed to several other projects, served as an author on multiple other publications, and peer-reviewed work for ICWSM '25 and HKS Misinformation Review.

In November 2024, I **passed my Ph.D. qualifying exam** - much thanks to my committee consisting of [Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/), [Polo Chau](https://poloclub.github.io/polochau/), [B. Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/), and [Bo Dai](https://bo-dai.github.io/)!


## Current Work

At the moment, I am working on two projects. In the **first**, I am developing a benchmark for **robustness of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realistic and plausible semantic perturbations** in the text and image modalities. Specifically:
- (1) I am working to create an extensive suite of input perturbations to enable a vigorous evaluation of MLLMs' robustness across a myriad of reasoning tasks and state-of-the-art models.
- (2) I am looking to develop techniques to make MLLMs more robust to such perturbations.

In the **second**, I am investigating the **dynamics of online misinformation and counter-misinformation**. Questions I am trying to answer include:
- (1) What kinds of misinformation-spreading users are more likely to receive countering or debunking responses from ordinary online users?
- (2) What kinds of users are more likely to be the creators of misinformation-countering content?

<!-- Overall, I enjoy working in **inter-disciplinary projects**, particularly at the intersection of computer science and humanities / public policy. I am motivated by a desire to help both stakeholders and ordinary people better understand and model complex societal phenomena, in the hope of bringing about tangible benefits and healthier societal outcomes. -->
